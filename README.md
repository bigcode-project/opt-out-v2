# Opt-out process for The Stack

You can opt-out repositories from [The Stack dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/bigcode/the-stack) by creating an issue in this repository and listing the repositories you would like to exclude. Read more on the [BigCode website](https://www.bigcode-project.org/docs/about/the-stack/#how-can-i-request-that-my-data-be-removed-from-the-stack). By creating an issue we can verify that you are the owner of the repositories requested for opt-out.

You can create an opt-out issue [here](https://github.com/bigcode-project/opt-out-v2/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=opt-out-request.md&title=Opt-out+request+for+USERNAME).
